## Why

I've need something like this many times. So here's a module to make my future life easier maybe.

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

Add `https://github.com/dagronf/DSFDropFilesView` to your project.

## Usage

### Via Interface Builder

Add a new `NSView` instance using Interface Builder, then change the class type to `DSFDropFilesView`

### Programatically

```swift
let dropView = DSFDropFilesView(frame: .zero)
```

### SwiftUI

See below.

### Objective-C

Add `https://github.com/dagronf/DSFDropFilesView` to your project.

Note that if you need to use `DSFDropFilesView` in Objective-C projects supporting macOS earlier than 10.14, you will also need to make sure to set `Always Embed Swift Standard Libraries` to `Yes` in the project settings. Before macOS 10.14 the Swift standard libraries are not distributed as part of the macOS installation and you'll need to provide your own in your application.

## Delegation

To receive callbacks from the control, set the `dropDelegate` to your view controller.

```swift
@objc optional func dropFilesViewWantsSelectFiles(_ sender: DSFDropFilesView)
```
An optional method that gets called if the user clicks the 'Select files...' button on the control.

```swift
func dropFilesView(_ sender: DSFDropFilesView, validateFiles: [URL]) -> NSDragOperation
```
Called when the drag enters the view. Return the drag operation (or an empty array) to indicate how the drag is to proceed. Use this function to filter out if the 'wrong' types of files are dropped. (for example, if you only want to receive PDFs).

```swift
func dropFilesView(_ sender: DSFDropFilesView, didDropFiles files: [URL]) -> Bool
```
Called with the files when the user actually drops the files.

## Customizations

### Properties

These properties can all be configured via Interface Builder or programatically.

#### Allowed drop counts

* `allowsMultipleDrop` : Allow multiple files/folders to dropped

#### Select files button (optional)

* `selectFilesButtonLabel` : Embed a clickable button for accessibility with the specified label. If empty, doesn't display the button (default)
* `selectFilesButtonIsLink` : If the select files button is display, show the button as a hyperlink (blue underlined text) instead of a button.

#### Icon

* `showIcon` : Should we display an icon
* `icon` : The icon to display. A default icon is supplied

#### Label

* `label` : The text of the label. If empty, the label is hidden.
* `lineWidth` : The line width for the dotted border
* `cornerWidth` : The radius for the corners

## SwiftUI

### SwiftUI

There is a basic SwiftUI View that embeds the `DSFDropFilesView` control.

```swift
DSFDropFilesView.SwiftUI(
   isEnabled: true,
   allowsMultipleDrop: true,
   iconLabel: "Drop files here",
   selectFilesLabel: "Select Filesâ€¦",
   selectFilesButtonIsLink: true,
   validateFiles: { urls in
      // Check the urls, and return the appropriate drop mode
      return .copy
   },
   dropFiles: { urls in
      Swift.print("\(urls)")
      return true
   },
   selectFiles: {
      Swift.print("User clicked select files")
   }
)
```
